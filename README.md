<h1>Sign Up Servlet Project With Oracle Database</h1>

<p>This Project Is Similar To My Login Project But It Has Some Differences</p>

<p>I've Used <b>Oracle Database 19c</b> As My Database For This Project</p>

<p>I've Added A <b>Sign Up Section</b></p>

<p>The Information Of Sign Up Section Is Processed By <b>SignupServlet</b></p>

<p>Also The Database Codes Are In A Separate File Named <b>DB.java</b></p>
